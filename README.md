The site needs to be served up on `localhost` using a webserver.
The steps below show how this can be achieved using `express` (and the `serve-index` package to show directory listings).

2. Start the server with the command `node express`
3. With the server running, visit the site: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
